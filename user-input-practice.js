// Remember that you can comment parts of your code in and out!
// Try this as you move from question to question below.

// 1. Ask the user to enter a number, and print out "The square root of ___ is ___ ", but with the blanks filled in correctly. (Not sure how to get the square root of a number in JavaScript? Google it!)

// var userNumber = readline.question("Please enter the number you want square rooted: ");
// console.log("The square root of " + userNumber + " is " + Math.sqrt(userNumber) + ".");

// 2. Ask the user to enter their name, and print out "Your name has ___ letters", but with the blank filled in. Not sure how to get the number of letters in a string in JavaScript? Google it!

// var userName = readline.question("What is your name: ");
// console.log("Your name has " + userName.length + " letters.");

// 3. Ask the user to enter any word, and print out "The word ____ starts with the letter ___", but with the blanks filled in. Not sure how to get the first letter of a string in JavaScript? ...

// var userWord = readline.question("Please enter a word: ");
// console.log("The word " + userWord + " starts with the letter " + userWord.charAt(0));

// 4. Ask the user to enter two numbers, and print out "The average of ___ and ___ is ____", but with the blanks filled in.

var userNumber1 = parseInt(readline.question("Please enter a number: "));
var userNumber2 = parseInt(readline.question("Please enter a second number: "));
console.log("The average of " + userNumber1 + " and " + userNumber2 + " is " + ((userNumber1 + userNumber2) / 2));
